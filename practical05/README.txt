fibonacci.c and fibonacci.f90:
C and FORTRAN90 programs that take a user given input,
positive non-zero integer n, then prints the fibonacci series
with n numbers

arctanh.c:
A program that calculates the value of arctanh(x) from -0.9 to 0.9 in 0.01 steps
using two methods. The first uses a Maclauring series approximation to
a user given precision, real positive delta (recommended value is 0.00000001).
The second uses aproximations to the natural log. It prints out the values
from both methods, then prints the RMSE between the methods.
